We still need to further evaluate the detection algorithm. We can use Python OpenCV for image processing, combined with information from depth cameras and LiDAR, to locate targets and detect objects. In the future, if feasible, we may also explore deep learning methods such as YOLOv8 and Mask R-CNN to evaluate detection success rates and overall performance.

Additionally, the following aspects need to be considered during the design phase and will be continuously improved during implementation:
- Design metrics to evaluate the efficiency and robustness of the software system.  
- Analyze potential risks and corresponding mitigation strategies.  
- Analyze potential failures (e.g., recognition failures, navigation path interruptions, grasping deviations).  
- Design corresponding error detection and recovery mechanisms:  
  - Timeout retry mechanisms.  
  - Error logging and analysis.
