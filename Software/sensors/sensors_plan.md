# sensors introduction
We plan to use the existing ROS 2 sensor configuration package and design the robot for this project to primarily use four types of sensors: a camera, a depth camera, an IMU, and an Rplidar. This package includes subscribers and publishers for data from the four sensor nodes. The software package allows communication between the robot and the sensors.
